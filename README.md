Python projects, programs and challenges.

Fruit of summer holidays' evenings.

If error 'No module named module_name' occurs while starting .py program, you need to install module named module_name.

If working on Windows, you can do it by entering Python installation directory, then 'Scripts' folder, then opening console there (hold 'Shift', right-click mouse and there you got 'Open Command Window Here') and typing 'pip install module_name'.
